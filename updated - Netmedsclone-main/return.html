          </p>
          <p>
            User cannot return non-refundable Product; it is User’s

            returnable/non-returnable category before placing an order.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also understand that various circumstances may compel you to
            return a product or products that are not defective. In these cases,
            we may allow the return of unopened, unused products after deducting

            At Reliance, we do our best to ensure that you are completely
            satisfied with our products. And we are happy to issue a full refund
            based on the conditions listed below:
          </p>
          <p>
            Full Refund Possible If: <br />

            in your account. While we regret any inconvenience caused by this

            The Website/App shall be only an intermediary connecting the User
