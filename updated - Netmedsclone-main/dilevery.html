            you by writing to your email ID and/or mobile number registered with
            us. We disclaim all liabilities that may arise on account of our
            failure to inform or notify you of delays in the delivery of
            purchased Products on the Platform. Further, we shall be under no
            obligation to compensate you for any claim that may otherwise arise
