Project-E pharma website
This is an Indian E-pharma Website and we made this clone in just 4 Days. The flow of the website is Homepage -> product page -> Specific Product page -> Cart page -> Payment page -> Address Page -> Order Confirmation page. If you want to buy the product you have to go in the navbar and hover on Categories and then Select Menu select Boots then You redirect to the BOOT Page. We use Local Storage Only that's why we only added a boots Section.

Issue We faced-
so when we were trying to marge and deploy our project then all the files were having merging issues so then we went through the process and found that some css files were same then we change the that then deployed our project.

We were a team of 4 from the Masai Web-15 batch who worked on cloning the Netmeds website as part of our Unit-2 construct week. As a team, we were given a project to clone the Netmeds website. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an e-commerce page, where a customer can view and filter products, add their product to a cart and place his or her happy order.
